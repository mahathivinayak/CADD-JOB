## Banana:
## Problem Statment :-

Design hardware to add two 8-bit unsigned BCD numbers. Sketch a schematic for your design, and
write an HDL module for the BCD adder. The inputs are A, B, and Cin, and the outputs are S and
Cout. Cin and Cout are 1-bit carries, and A, B, and S are 8-bit BCD numbers.

### Instructions :- 

- Understand BCD numbers and the addition of BCD numbers
- Write the algorithm for BCD addition
- Functional simulation
- Synthesis
## Jackfruit:
## Problem Statment :-

In this problem, you will explore the design of a 32-bit floating point multiplier. The multiplier has
two 32-bit floating-point inputs and produces a 32-bit floating-point output. You may consider
positive numbers only and use round toward zero (truncate).

(a) Write the steps necessary to perform 32-bit floating-point multiplication.
(b) Sketch the schematic of a 32-bit floating-point multiplier.
(c) Design a 32-bit floating-point multiplier in an HDL. Simulate and test your multiplier to prove
to a skeptic that it functions correctly.

In this problem, you will explore the design of a 32-bit prefix adder.
(a) Sketch a schematic of your design.
(b) Design the 32-bit prefix adder in an HDL. Simulate and test your adder to prove that it functions
correctly.
(c) What is the delay of your 32-bit prefix adder from part (a)? Assume that each two-input gate
delay is 100 ps.
(d) Design a pipelined version of the 32-bit prefix adder. Sketch the schematic of your design. How
fast can your pipelined prefix adder run? Make the design run as fast as possible.
(e) Design the pipelined 32-bit prefix adder in an HDL
